If you want contribute, please make a pull request. :) Any feedback you have would be greatly appreciated.

## Pull Requests

*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm run test`).
5. Try to follow the [code conventions](#code-conventions).

<!-- TODO 5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`) -->


## Style Guide

We have not set up any linting yet, so try to see how the existing code is written and write in a similar style.

#### Code Conventions

* Prefer ES-2015 syntax
* Use semicolons `;`
* 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Prefer `'` over `"`
* Write "attractive" code


## Bugs

#### Where to Find Known Issues

Please use GitHub Issues to report bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing an issue, try to make sure it doesn't already exist.

#### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a code example which reproduces it. jsFiddle, jsBin, and other sites provide a way to give live examples.
