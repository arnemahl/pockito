Consider: Should initialState have to comply with validators or not?

---
Fix: Undocumented errors get thrown when they should be logged.

---
Performance:
* Rename _handleError to _handleMessage, pass string instead of error. If 'throw' then `throw new Error(message)`

Related:
* Add option to console.log all store updates.

---

Safeguard when trying to overwrite
    * A Listenable (sub-store)
    * A reserved property / method on of Listenable.

----

Consider: (may be a bad idea?)
Store.addListener(fn, 'subStore');

if the property you want to listen to is also a Listenable, add the listener to the Listenable
